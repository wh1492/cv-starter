# CV-STARTER

Transform your WordPress into a CV platform using the Rest API, with a custom endpoint.

## Installation

Just as any other wordpress plugin. Download, unzip in your `/plugins/` folder, go to admin and activate it.

## Endpoint

Use the customized Endpoint to get all the information available by adding "/wp-json/cv/v1" to your site.
Test it in Postman or Insomnia.

```bash
http://demoserver.url/wp-json/cv/v1
```

## Todos

 - Add custom metaboxes to the loop
